PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an <strong>online multiplayer <u>battle royale</u> game</strong> developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction.<img src="pubg.jpg" width="100%"><p>Battlegrounds was first released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017.
